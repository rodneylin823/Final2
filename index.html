                   <span class="content"><h2>Michael Whyte</h2><p>In the 90's I graduated from Toronto's Humber College Multi-Media program when multi-media was starting to move from analog to digital.

                    After Humber, I entered the world of live event staging, specializing in technical show management, live event multi-media, and teleprompting. It is a great business that allowed me to travel extensively around North America working with some of Canada’s largest corporations.
                            
                    Currently I am an instructor at BCIT for the Technical Web Designer program. A five month program that focuses on front-end web design and development.
                            
                    I also teach a pair of introductory part-time web development courses (COMP 1850 and COMP 1950) offered at night through BCIT's part-time studies department.</p></span>
